# Hi, I'm Micah! 👋

**Data Analyst & Financial Consultant** | **MS Business Analytics Candidate** | **Former EY Consultant**

## 🚀 What I Do

**The intersection of finance and data science.** I help companies make smarter decisions by transforming scattered spreadsheets into strategic dashboards that executives actually use.
