<h1>Hi, I am Micah! 

<h2>✨About me:</h2>

<br>🎓**My Academic Journey**:<br>
My academic journey began at Norfolk State University, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Business with a concentration in Management. During this time, I served as the Vice President of Membership Communication for the Golden Key International Honour Society, coordinating initiatives to engage current and potential members and promoting activities across campus. I was also a member of the National Association of Black Accountants (NABA). These leadership roles, along with three internships—two at Ernst & Young and one at TowneBank—equipped me with valuable skills for leadership in complex, fast-paced environments. Currently, I am pursuing my dream opportunity by completing my Master of Science in Business Analytics at the College of William & Mary, where I serve as the Co-President of the MSBA Council. With this opportunity, I am excited to leverage my passion for data to drive strategic decisions and create impactful solutions across business landscapes.

<br>💼**Expertise in Practice**:<br>
As a consultant at Ernst & Young, I played a pivotal role in driving impactful projects in mergers & acquisitions and SAP integrations. Collaborating with cross-functional teams, I contributed to complex analyses and crafted innovative solutions that optimized processes and enhanced client satisfaction. My experience reinforced my ability to navigate challenges in fast-paced environments while fostering teamwork and communication. Prior to that, I gained valuable insights during my internships. At TowneBank, I engaged in various financial operations, honing my analytical skills and understanding of banking practices. My time with Ernst & Young included overseeing critical engagements that involved managing client documentation and conducting risk assessments, allowing me to deepen my financial expertise and learn the intricacies of regulatory compliance. These experiences laid the foundation for my current pursuit of a Master of Science in Business Analytics at the College of William & Mary.

<br>🌼**My Competitive Edge**:<br>
I am a strong contender for this internship due to my extensive project management experience and results-oriented approach. I successfully co-led an SAP integration project, directing updates, presenting findings to leadership, and training team members—all while developing pricing plans and ensuring project alignment with client objectives. Additionally, during the FP&A Technical Roadmap Assessment, I collaborated with a five-member team to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment, implement "wavespace" training, and create a strategic timeline that enhanced profitability. My proven ability to deliver impactful solutions and optimize financial systems positions me as an exceptional candidate for this opportunity. I look forward to opportunities that will enhance my professional growth and wisdom across various areas of business.
